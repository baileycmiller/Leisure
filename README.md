# Leisure
Leisure is an iOS app made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and compiled in Cordova.

Leisure is a place for hobbies. It's designed to inspire its users to take advantage of their free time, learn new things, and find their passions. The iOS app has a database of hobbies for its users to explore, featuring descriptions, skill level information, and physical activity information. The app then lets its users collect their favorite hobbies for reference on the "My Hobbies" page. There's also a fun quiz feature that helps users find their potential calling.
